# GitHub DevOps Workshop Introduction

## Workshop Sessions

The GitHub DevOps Workshop that may be delivered onsite through a classroom experience or over-the-wire with GitHub's Learning Lab platform.

The illustration below shows the DevOps "loop" lifecycle and where each of the four workshop sessions fit into an overall DevOps CI/CD lifecycle.

This sessions reviews the use of GitHub as a foundational practice to foster orthodox DevOps practice. The session reviews with students a hands-on lab teaching the fundamental aspects of GitHub Flow and how it may be applied to a CI/CD context. The workshop covers:

- Repository Creation
- Cloning a Repository
- Protecting the Master Branch
- Making Changes To Files On Your Local Machine
- Committing and Pushing Changes To A Feature Branch
- Openning a Pull Request To Facilitate Code Review
- Merging A Feature Branch With Master

In a DevOps context, the use of a branch merge strategy will enable GitHUb event triggers to be used for CI/CD automation. The fundamentals of GitHub Flow establish the team practice that enables development, testing, and initial team-level deployments to be automated.

The Continuous Integration session build upon the fundamental use of GitHub for VCS and instructs the student on the use of GitHub Workflow Actions to enable an automated build and unit test process. As a precursor to the Continuous Delivery session, this workshop focusses on the following practices:

- Initial development of a GitHub Workflow
- Enabling a build process such as Maven or Gradle through workflows
- Implementation of Unit Tests through the build
- The persistence of build artifacts to the GitHub Package Registry
- Using Docker to package an application for a container deployment
- Using Docker Hub as a container registry

The Continuous Delivery session builds upon the Continuous Integration session and guides the student through the use of a GitHub Actions Workflow to deploy the persisted application package or container image to a team server. The workshop session focusses on:

- Use of event triggers to launch different workflows based on developer events
- Deploying a conventional package to a virtual machine in a public cloud
- Deploying a containerized application to a Kubernetes Cluster in a public cloud
- Creating release snapshots to enable rollback and recovery
- Enabling application workload promotion through dev, test and pre-production targets
- Deploying to production

### <img width="50" alt="Release Automation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43185011/64967417-75733f00-d86e-11e9-95e7-796965bd9e1a.png"> Session 4: DevOps CI/CD for regulated contexts, continuous delivery release automation

In this workshop, students will use the recently released GitHub pipeline actions and other capabilities to deploy to conventional virtual environmentsâ€”and develop a number of deployment options using polyglot application workload examples. Students will also implement deployment workflows and release automation to eliminate manual hand-off's and accommodate GRC (Governance, Risk Management, Audit, and Compliance). Learn how to:
- Profile application workloads for various gating contexts
- Implement automated approval and gating processes to facilitate stakeholder deployment approvals
- Deploy conventional application build artifacts and packages to virtual servers in a cloud infrastructure.
